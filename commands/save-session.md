# 保存会话命令

捕获此会话中发生的一切——构建了什么，什么成功了，什么失败了，还剩什么——并将其写入带日期的文件，以便下一个会话可以准确地从停止的地方继续。

## 使用场景

- 关闭 Claude Code 之前结束工作会话
- 在达到上下文限制之前（先运行此命令，然后开始新的会话）
- 解决了一个想要记住的复杂问题之后
- 任何需要将上下文移交给未来会话的时候

## 流程

### 步骤 1: 收集上下文

在写入文件之前，收集：

- 阅读此会话期间修改的所有文件（使用 git diff 或从对话中回忆）
- 回顾讨论了什么、尝试了什么、决定了什么
- 记下遇到的任何错误以及如何解决的（或没有解决）
- 检查当前的测试/构建状态（如果相关）

### 步骤 2: 如果会话文件夹不存在则创建它

在用户的 Claude 主目录中创建规范的会话文件夹：

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/session-data
```

### 步骤 3: 写入会话文件

创建 `~/.claude/session-data/YYYY-MM-DD-<short-id>-session.tmp`，使用今天的实际日期和满足 `session-manager.js` 中 `SESSION_FILENAME_REGEX` 规则约束的短 ID：

- 兼容字符：`a-z` / `A-Z`、数字 `0-9`、连字符 `-`、下划线 `_`
- 兼容最小长度：1 个字符
- 新文件推荐样式：小写字母、数字和连字符，8+ 字符以避免冲突

有效示例：`abc123de`、`a1b2c3d4`、`frontend-worktree-1`、`ChezMoi_2`
新文件避免：`A`、`test_id1`、`ABC123de`

完整有效文件名示例：`2024-01-15-abc123de-session.tmp`

旧文件名格式 `YYYY-MM-DD-session.tmp` 仍然有效，但新会话文件应优先使用短 ID 格式以避免同日冲突。

### 步骤 4: 用以下所有部分填充文件

诚实撰写每个部分。不要跳过部分——如果某个部分确实没有内容，写上"暂无"或"N/A"。不完整的文件比诚实空着的部分更糟糕。

### 步骤 5: 向用户展示文件

写入后，显示完整内容并询问：

```
会话已保存到 [实际解析的会话文件路径]

这看起来准确吗？在我们关闭之前有什么需要纠正或添加的吗？
```

等待确认。如有请求，进行编辑。

## 会话文件格式

```markdown
# Session: YYYY-MM-DD

**Started:** [approximate time if known]
**Last Updated:** [current time]
**Project:** [project name or path]
**Topic:** [one-line summary of what this session was about]

---

## What We Are Building

[1-3 paragraphs describing the feature, bug fix, or task. Include enough
context that someone with zero memory of this session can understand the goal.
Include: what it does, why it's needed, how it fits into the larger system.]

---

## What WORKED (with evidence)

[List only things that are confirmed working. For each item include WHY you
know it works — test passed, ran in browser, Postman returned 200, etc.
Without evidence, move it to "Not Tried Yet" instead.]

- **[thing that works]** — confirmed by: [specific evidence]
- **[thing that works]** — confirmed by: [specific evidence]

If nothing is confirmed working yet: "Nothing confirmed working yet — all approaches still in progress or untested."

---

## What Did NOT Work (and why)

[This is the most important section. List every approach tried that failed.
For each failure write the EXACT reason so the next session doesn't retry it.
Be specific: "threw X error because Y" is useful. "didn't work" is not.]

- **[approach tried]** — failed because: [exact reason / error message]
- **[approach tried]** — failed because: [exact reason / error message]

If nothing failed: "No failed approaches yet."

---

## What Has NOT Been Tried Yet

[Approaches that seem promising but haven't been attempted. Ideas from the
conversation. Alternative solutions worth exploring. Be specific enough that
the next session knows exactly what to try.]

- [approach / idea]
- [approach / idea]

If nothing is queued: "No specific untried approaches identified."

---

## Current State of Files

[Every file touched this session. Be precise about what state each file is in.]

| File              | Status         | Notes                      |
| ----------------- | -------------- | -------------------------- |
| `path/to/file.ts` | PASS: Complete    | [what it does]             |
| `path/to/file.ts` |  In Progress | [what's done, what's left] |
| `path/to/file.ts` | FAIL: Broken      | [what's wrong]             |
| `path/to/file.ts` |  Not Started | [planned but not touched]  |

If no files were touched: "No files modified this session."

---

## Decisions Made

[Architecture choices, tradeoffs accepted, approaches chosen and why.
These prevent the next session from relitigating settled decisions.]

- **[decision]** — reason: [why this was chosen over alternatives]

If no significant decisions: "No major decisions made this session."

---

## Blockers & Open Questions

[Anything unresolved that the next session needs to address or investigate.
Questions that came up but weren't answered. External dependencies waiting on.]

- [blocker / open question]

If none: "No active blockers."

---

## Exact Next Step

[If known: The single most important thing to do when resuming. Be precise
enough that resuming requires zero thinking about where to start.]

[If not known: "Next step not determined — review 'What Has NOT Been Tried Yet'
and 'Blockers' sections to decide on direction before starting.]

---

## Environment & Setup Notes

[Only fill this if relevant — commands needed to run the project, env vars
required, services that need to be running, etc. Skip if standard setup.]

[If none: omit this section entirely.]
```

## 示例输出

```markdown
# Session: 2024-01-15

**Started:** ~2pm
**Last Updated:** 5:30pm
**Project:** my-app
**Topic:** Building JWT authentication with httpOnly cookies

---

## What We Are Building

User authentication system for the Next.js app. Users register with email/password,
receive a JWT stored in an httpOnly cookie (not localStorage), and protected routes
check for a valid token via middleware. The goal is session persistence across browser
refreshes without exposing the token to JavaScript.

---

## What WORKED (with evidence)

- **`/api/auth/register` endpoint** — confirmed by: Postman POST returns 200 with user
  object, row visible in Supabase dashboard, bcrypt hash stored correctly
- **JWT generation in `lib/auth.ts`** — confirmed by: unit test passes
  (`npm test -- auth.test.ts`), decoded token at jwt.io shows correct payload
- **Password hashing** — confirmed by: `bcrypt.compare()` returns true in test

---

## What Did NOT Work (and why)

- **Next-Auth library** — failed because: conflicts with our custom Prisma adapter,
  threw "Cannot use adapter with credentials provider in this configuration" on every
  request. Not worth debugging — too opinionated for our setup.
- **Storing JWT in localStorage** — failed because: SSR renders happen before
  localStorage is available, caused React hydration mismatch error on every page load.
  This approach is fundamentally incompatible with Next.js SSR.

---

## What Has NOT Been Tried Yet

- Store JWT as httpOnly cookie in the login route response (most likely solution)
- Use `cookies()` from `next/headers` to read token in server components
- Write middleware.ts to protect routes by checking cookie existence

---

## Current State of Files

| File                             | Status         | Notes                                           |
| -------------------------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `app/api/auth/register/route.ts` | PASS: Complete    | Works, tested                                   |
| `app/api/auth/login/route.ts`    |  In Progress | Token generates but not setting cookie yet      |
| `lib/auth.ts`                    | PASS: Complete    | JWT helpers, all tested                         |
| `middleware.ts`                  |  Not Started | Route protection, needs cookie read logic first |
| `app/login/page.tsx`             |  Not Started | UI not started                                  |

---

## Decisions Made

- **httpOnly cookie over localStorage** — reason: prevents XSS token theft, works with SSR
- **Custom auth over Next-Auth** — reason: Next-Auth conflicts with our Prisma setup, not worth the fight

---

## Blockers & Open Questions

- Does `cookies().set()` work inside a Route Handler or only in Server Actions? Need to verify.

---

## Exact Next Step

In `app/api/auth/login/route.ts`, after generating the JWT, set it as an httpOnly
cookie using `cookies().set('token', jwt, { httpOnly: true, secure: true, sameSite: 'strict' })`.
Then test with Postman — the response should include a `Set-Cookie` header.
```

---

## 注意事项

- 每个会话获得自己的文件——永不追加到前一个会话的文件
- "What Did NOT Work" 部分是最关键的——未来会话如果没有它会盲目重试失败的方法
- 如果用户在会话中间要求保存（不仅仅是结束时），保存目前已知的内容并明确标记进行中的项目
- 该文件旨在通过 `/resume-session` 在下一个会话开始时由 Claude 读取
- 使用规范的全局会话存储：`~/.claude/session-data/`
- 优先使用短 ID 文件名形式（`YYYY-MM-DD-<short-id>-session.tmp`）用于任何新的会话文件
